SecretSafe
The xor 32768 bit encrypted notepad for now.

# Secret Safe

## Pros:
- Uses XOR encryption with a 32768 bit key
- Uses SHA3-512 to hash password to create key
- Imposible to crack if smaller than 32768 bits (1024 characters)
- Password SaltingðŸ§‚

## Cons:
- Large save files, save files can be 1.5 to 6 times larger than unencrypted couterpart
- Can only take notes
- Bad password check, just doesn't do anything
- Can be cracked if charater length is a large multiple of 1024.

## ToDo List:
- [ ] Better Encryption, make it AES-like
- [ ] Password Check Response
- [ ] Make UI inside app
- [ ] Make password Genorator
- [ ] Make better setup page
- [ ] Make Icon
- [ ] Make cool download page
